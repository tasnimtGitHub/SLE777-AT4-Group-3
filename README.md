## Project Objective

This repository aims to:

- Provide a comprehensive analysis of gene expression data (RNA-Seq) and tree growth data using R.
- Demonstrate data wrangling, mathematical operations, and visualizations.
- Compare biological sequence diversity between E. coli and another organism through codon usage, sequence length, and nucleotide/amino acid frequency analyses.
- Showcase teamwork and collaboration through contributions and commits using GitHub.
- Create reproducible R scripts that yield clear and accurate results, including tables and plots.
- Ensure thorough documentation (README and comments) to facilitate understanding of each workflow step.
