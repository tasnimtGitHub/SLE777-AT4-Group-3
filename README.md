## Integrated Analysis of Gene Expression and Biological Sequences in R


## Project Objective

This repository aims to:

- Provide a comprehensive analysis of gene expression data (RNA-Seq) and tree growth data using R.
- Demonstrate data wrangling, mathematical operations, and visualizations.
- Compare biological sequence diversity between E. coli and another organism through codon usage, sequence length, and nucleotide/amino acid frequency analyses.
- Showcase teamwork and collaboration through contributions and commits using GitHub.
- Create reproducible R scripts that yield clear and accurate results, including tables and plots.
- Ensure thorough documentation (README and comments) to facilitate understanding of each workflow step.

## Part 1: Importing Files, Data Wrangling, Mathematical Operations, Plots, and Saving Code on GitHub

### Content

Part 1 is divided into two main sections:

1. *RNA-Seq Count Data Analysis:* Analyzes RNA-seq count data from the gene_expression.tsv file, which includes expression data for three samples. The data is processed and converted to numeric format for analysis. Key steps include calculating mean expression values, identifying the top 10 genes with the highest mean expression, and visualizing the distribution of mean values using histograms. This section demonstrates fundamental skills in processing gene expression data, computing descriptive statistics, and visualizing results.

2. *Tree Growth Data Analysis:* Explores tree growth data from the growth_data.csv file, tracking tree circumference at two different sites (control and treatment) over a 20-year period. The analysis includes computing mean and standard deviation, comparing growth rates, and performing a t-test to assess statistical significance, visualized using box plots.

### Purpose and Significance

Part 1 highlights key data analysis techniques using R, focusing on data importation, manipulation, and statistical computation. It emphasizes the importance of data visualization through histograms and box plots and the application of statistical tests, such as the t-test, to assess the significance of differences between two samples. The exercises provide hands-on experience with biological and environmental datasets while promoting team collaboration through GitHub for version control and project management.

## Part 2: Examining Biological Sequence Diversity

### Content

This section investigates genetic differences between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and E. coli by analyzing their coding DNA sequences (CDS), sourced from the Ensembl genome database. We calculate the total CDS count and length for each organism and perform statistical analyses, including summary statistics and box plots, to compare coding sequence lengths. 

Further analyses focus on nucleotide and amino acid composition, with bar plots created to visualize base and protein frequencies. Codon usage bias is assessed using codon tables and visualizations. We identify and compare the most over- and under-represented k-mers in the protein sequences of both organisms, uncovering important insights into sequence composition and potential functional differences.

### Purpose and Significance

Part 2 emphasizes the importance of comparing genetic sequence data to understand biological diversity. By examining differences in sequence length, codon usage, and k-mer representation between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and E. coli, the project provides insights into genomic organization and evolutionary pressures shaping these organisms. Analyzing codon usage bias uncovers evolutionary trends and adaptations that optimize protein synthesis for specific environments, while k-mer analysis offers a detailed perspective on nucleotide sequences and genomic characteristics. Together, these analyses deepen our understanding of the evolutionary and functional relationships between the two species.
